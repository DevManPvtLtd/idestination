Effective Date: 29-May-2023

Thank you for using iDestination, a cab application that aims to provide convenient and reliable transportation services. This Cancellation & Refund Policy outlines the guidelines for canceling rides and the associated refund process. By using the iDestination cab application, you agree to comply with the following policies:

**1. Ride Cancellation by Passengers**

1.1 Cancellation Window: Passengers can cancel a ride without incurring any cancellation fee within [X minutes] from the time of booking or before a driver has been assigned, whichever comes first.

1.2 Cancellation Fee: If a passenger cancels a ride after a driver has been assigned and the cancellation falls outside the cancellation window mentioned above, a cancellation fee may apply. The cancellation fee amount may vary based on the city or region.

**2. Ride Cancellation by Drivers**

2.1 Valid Reasons: Drivers are expected to fulfill their commitment to riders once they have accepted a ride request. Cancellation by drivers is discouraged and should only occur in exceptional circumstances, such as vehicle breakdown, safety concerns, or unforeseen emergencies.

2.2 Penalties: Frequent and unjustified ride cancellations by drivers may result in penalties, including temporary or permanent suspension from the iDestination platform.

**3. Refund Policy**

3.1 Full Refund Scenarios: Passengers who cancel their rides within the specified cancellation window will receive a full refund of any pre-authorized payment made for the ride.

3.2 No Refund Scenarios: Passengers who cancel a ride after the cancellation window has elapsed, or in cases where a driver has already started the trip or arrived at the pickup location, are not eligible for a refund.

3.3 Driver Cancellation: If a driver cancels a ride after accepting the request but before initiating the trip, passengers will receive a full refund.

3.4 Unsuccessful Payment: In the event of a failed payment transaction or payment processing issue, passengers may be required to make a successful payment to confirm their booking. Failure to complete the payment may result in ride cancellation.

**4. Refund Processing**

4.1 Automatic Refunds: Refunds for eligible cancellations will be processed automatically, and the amount will be credited back to the original payment method used for the booking.

4.2 Processing Time: The time taken for the refund to reflect in the passenger's account may vary depending on the payment method and the respective financial institution's policies.
